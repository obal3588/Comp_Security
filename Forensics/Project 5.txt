(Evidence_Ques_4)


5. Were there any suspicious-looking encrypted files on the machine? If so, please attach them
and their decrypted contents as evidence and briefly describe how you obtained the contents.
A suspicious file called passwords.zip was found. 
5 password files were found. Using the fcrackzip tool, the password "soelite" was extracted. The below command was used : fcrackzip -b -c a -p AAAAAAAA -v -u -l 3-8 passwords.zip

Using this password, the password files were open to find the following : 
password1.txt : enigma
password2.txt : love
password3.txt : supersecret
password4.txt : KERMIT
password5.txt : eeMeisei700x

All the above files have been attached.

Nerf gun search on ebay was also made (image attached : ebay_nerf_image & ebay_nerf) 




7. Did the suspect try to delete any files before his arrest? Please attach the name(s) of the file(s)
and any indications of their contents that you can find. (Hint: We will be impressed if you
manage to recover the original contents of a particular incriminating file, but we do not expect
you to do so.)
Attempt to delete evil_plan.bmp was made the night before the murder. Some password files were also attempted to be deleted.
Attached are the evidences for the same. (attempt_to_delete_bmp_file.png and Delete_files.png)


8. Reconstruct the timeline of actions by the suspect that may be relevant to the investigation.
(Make a list in this format: <date> <time>: <event description>.) Include any activities

suspect logged in to or booted the machine. When was the last activity before the suspect fled
the country?

9. Is there anything else suspicious about the machine? Attach relevant evidence as appropriate.
The suspect seems to have made remote machine connection. Evidence is attached as 9_1 and 9_2 
Suspect made an attempt to login to the remote machine using the below command and the system appears to be a Server.
ssh -l root 54.147.125.121
Password : eeMeisei700x

 or 
http://{ip}:{port}/
http://54.147.125.121:80/
Evidence_9 file has the evidence of suspect attempting to login to the remote machine. 


10. Who owns this machine, according to the files on it?
From the file /etc/passwd
Username : academic
The user info is captured in 10_.png

11. What does its purpose appear to be? 
    (Hint: What network service is running?)
http://54.147.125.121:80/ is hosting the application(Apache server)
Network services are captured in screenshot 11_.png


12. Was the suspect granted access to the machine, or was it compromised? If the suspect was granted access, when? If it was    compromised, when and how was it compromised?
Suspect was not granted access to the remote system. Evidence shows that suspect made multiple attempts to login to the system using different passwords. All the failed login attempts are evident in the snapshot (12_1,12_2). 

The auth.log.1 file shows that there were multiple SSH login attempts from 141.212.111.41. On Nefarious's computer's auth.log, it can be seen that the command "ifconfig eth0 141.212.111.41" has been run. Also, the source code for Hydra was found on Nefarious's PC. This would indicate that Nefarious used Hydra to try to crack the ssh password of Dr. Academic Researcher's SSH server. The access was gained on Nov 25th at 10:31:35. It also shows that Nefarious changed the root password twice for the server on the next day.


13. In either case, it appears as though the suspect has abused his access to the machine. How?
Suspect made use of Hydra password cracking tool to login to the remote machine. Evidence_9 file has the evidence of suspect attempting to login to the remote machine. 

The HTML used for the HTTP page has a comment: <!--The duck flies at midnight! -->. The HTML file, present in /var/www/ in Dr. Researcher's SSH server, was last modified on November 25th at 10:36:30, which is just after Nefarious gained access to the host. Since the murder seems to have been committed around midnight, the given comment may have been a way of secretly communicating.


14. The comment has been removed from the HTML source. If, however, Nefarious changed more of the HTML than just the comment, it may be impossible to recover that. However, it is unlikely that Nefarious has changed more of the webpage since otherwise it would be readily apparent to anyone who viewed the webpage.
